We want a system where we can buy yachts and jewelry, and thousand dollar tshirts, and wear them and look down on all the dirty lazy scum who have to buy their shirts at WalMart for 5 bucks."

## Capitalism Is A System Of Putting Profit Above All Else

Just look at the root of the word capitalism. Capital. Money. If we wanted the system to put people first, why would we call it essentially &ldquo;Moneyism?&rdquo; If we wanted a system that put people first, we&apos;d have used a root like &ldquo;community&rdquo; or &ldquo;society,&rdquo; and called the system something like &ldquo;communuism,&rdquo; or &ldquo;socialism.&rdquo; But we&apos;re not a bunch of whiny, bleeding heart pussies, and we don&apos;t want some weak society that cares about people. We want a system where we can buy yachts and jewelry, and thousand dollar tshirts, and wear them and look down on all the dirty lazy scum who have to buy their shirts at WalMart for 5 bucks.

## Every Other Human Being Is Nothing More Than Competition Or Customers

Human beings are nothing more than a market or competition. If they ain&apos;t buying from you or competing with you, they&apos;re irrelevant. And if they&apos;re competing, they are The Enemy, and must be eradicated. All that matters is maximizing profit. If squeezing wages to an unlivable level increases shareholder value, you squeeze them fuckers are hard as you can. Let them go beg the government for handouts in the form of foodstamps and rent subsidies. That ain&apos;t the responsibility of an employer in a capitalist economy. Employee well-being is the employees&apos; problem, not the business&apos;. The objective of a business is *profit*. Nothing more, nothing less.

## Parasitism Is A Successful Natural Strategy

The best products to sell are ones people **need**. Addictive substances are great. Even better is healthcare. You can charge people outrageous amounts if it&apos;s their life on the line. It&apos;s just too bad we can&apos;t bottle and sell all the air. And the socialist regulations on food and water should be lifted so those markets could be cornered, and **tons** of money could be made selling food and water to people starving and dying of dehydration. Motivated consumers are the best consumers.

## Stupid Customers Are The Best Customers

Capitalism, by design, is a great system for fleecing morons. If you&apos;re dumb enough to believe that used car was never in a wreck and only had one owner, you **deserve** to get ripped off. Dumb people will buy anything, and seldom ask questions. Often, if dissatisfied with a product, they are easily convinced it&apos;s their own fault, not the product or service. They&apos;re used to being stupid and screwing things up. They expect it.

## Socialist Whining

During hurricanes, people whine about &ldquo;price gouging,&rdquo; but there&apos;s really no such thing in capitalism. You charge what the market will bear. If you **can** sell a bottle of water for a million bucks, you **do it.** That&apos;s just good capitalism. Anyone who whines about that is a socialist. A good capitalist sees a starving child and sees an opportunity to sell a sandwich. Only whiny, weak, libtards are stupid enough to want to **give** the kid a sandwich.

## This Is Our System, Love It Or Leave It

America is a capitalist country. That&apos;s that. If you don&apos;t like it, **leave it.** If you think we should be a socialist country that saves people&apos;s lives for *free,* you should go to some pinko commie country where idiot ideas like that belong.
