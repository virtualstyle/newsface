## &ldquo;Make Up A Reason!&rdquo;

President Trump, upon being told by an aide that there weren't any compelling reasons to attack Iran and start a large scale war, shouted &ldquo;Make up a reason!&rdquo; Continuing, &ldquo; it&apos;s not like it&apos;s never been done before. Judst do something like The Maine, or the Gulf of Tonkin. Americans are stupid, they&apos;ll believe anything, and my voters don&apos;t even need a reason, they&apos;ll attack anyone, anytime, reason or no reason, as long as I say so.

## &ldquo;We Gotta Go To War Here&rdquo;

&ldquo;We gotta go to war here,&rdquo; Trump said, &ldquo;these contractors are depending on it. Raytheon, GE, Xe, Halliburton. Fuck, **all** these guys are counting on us to run their stocks way up and make the economy look a lot better.&rdquo;

Experts on the situation in the Middle East all seem to be in agreement that there is no clear, compelling reason to initiate yet another open ended conflict in the volatile region for little to no cause other than the profit of multinational contractors. They also provided numerous warnings of bumbling into yet another conflict unprepared, with unrealistic expectations, no idea of what goals we might wish to accomplish, and **zero** considerations about any exit strategy, or what might constitute victory.
