## The US Is A Third World Country If You&apos;re Not The Right Color

The US is blatantly unequal. Reprehensibly so. By any metric, white America is doing fairly well. Black and brown America, not so much. Just a quick glance at any pertinent statistics, and anyone with a brain who is not in total denial can see the facts. They're staring us in the face every day. And yet, since they don&apos;t affect us, they&apos;re easy to ignore. Because what, are we supposed to have hearts? Are we supposed to care about our fellow man? Of course not. As long as we&apos;re not affected, who cares, right?

What does it matter if a huge percentage of our fellow citizens literally live in a different country, a country that might as well be a third world country? It&apos;s not our fault, right? Not like we&apos;re passively supporting a system of discrimination and hate that causes unnecessary death and suffering, right? Nah, we&apos;re good.
