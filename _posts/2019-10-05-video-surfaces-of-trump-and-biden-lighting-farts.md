## An Explosive Situation

In a video which surfaced today, President Trump and Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden are seen together in a hotel room, giggling like schoolboys as they use a disposable lighter to ignite each other&apos;s flatulence. Biden appears drunk, and there are empty beer bottles scattered everywhere. Trump, a teetotaller, is sober but manic, like an overtired prepubescent teen at a slumber party. Both men are in their underwear (Boxers for Biden and skimpy Armani bikini type for Trump), and they take turns bending over, laying down with their legs back over their heads, and finding numerous other imaginative contortions from which to aim and deploy their body gas for ignition.
