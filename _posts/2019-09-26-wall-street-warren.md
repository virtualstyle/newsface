excerpt: "Today, obscenely rich Wall Street tycoons made it clear that if required to pay their fair share, they would exert all their power and money to subvert the will of the people. Essentially these fat cats are openly saying that they get to pick Presidential candidates, and anyone who tries to obey the will of the people will be punished."
