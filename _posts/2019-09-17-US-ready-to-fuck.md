## A Stern, Lascivious Warning To Iran

> *&ldquo;America has a huge, tremendous, throbbing military hard on, and we can't wait to run it up in Iran's asshole.&rdquo;<br><br>&mdash;President Donald Trump*

Today, in apparent warning to Iran, whom he claims is responsible for the recent attacks on Saudi oil production infrastructure, President Trump told reporters &ldquo;America is ready to fuck. &rdquo; Continuing by saying &ldquo;America has a huge, tremendous, throbbing military hard on, and we can't wait to run it up in Iran's asshole.&rdquo;

## Normalized Insanity
This reporter cannot help but think how absolutely batshit crazy such an offensive and odd statement might have seemed just a short while ago. But today no one even batted an eyelash as Trump repeated his rather vulgar warning as he made humping motions in the air and up against the podium, even going as far as making slapping motions while grunting and uttering exclamations such as &ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Get dat ass!&rdquo;

> *&ldquo;This shit gets me so excited, I can't **wait** to drop my pants and get going on this.&rdquo;<br><br>&mdash;President Donald Trump*

&ldquo;This shit gets me so excited, I can't **wait** to drop my pants and get going on this,&rdquo; the President said, his left hand absently rubbing his crotch. Some in the crowd averted their eyes at the spectacle, but the POTUS was, unsurprisingly, oblivious to their discomfort as he continued the self-fondling as he talked about the power of US weaponry, and how many enemy combatants and civilian women and children might be killed, maimed, disfigured, and displaced as refugees.

Asked what specific conditions might precipitate a war, Trump waved his hand and shrugged his shoulders and gave a vague, &ldquo;I don't know, we'll see, maybe nothing,&rdquo; as response to this critical question, leaving America to wonder when we might send our kids to fight and die on the President's whim. A similar response was given to questions of what the goals of such a war might be, and what kind of exit strategy might exist.
