## &ldquo;Trump Did it First - He&apos;s Just Trying To Be Like Trump&rdquo;

Republican politicians, pundits, and voters are angry about Pete Buttigieg bragging about his penis size during the recent Democratic presidential candidate debates, saying &ldquo;Trump did it first,&rdquo; and &ldquo;he's not really that tough and secure, he&apos;s just trying to look like Trump. We all know that only the men who are the most secure in their masculinity brag about their penis size at every opportunity, even in Presidential debates, and Trump was the first candidate <b>ever</b> to be so secure to do so at a Presidential debate.&rdquo;

Buttigieg brought the issue up when apparently he felt his manhood was challenged by Beto O'Rourke, and decided to get personal and lecture the candidates and the audience about his vast depth of courage and penis length.

Republicans are appalled that a wimpy, short-dicked Democrat would dare to pretend to such a thing, which is clearly only a Republican virtue. &ldquo;We all know that all Democrats have small dicks and hate America,&rdquo; said one Republican voter,&rdquo; &ldquo;just watch Fox News, they'll tell you that. This is just yet another example of Democrats trying to steal good ideas from Republicans and pretend they came up with them. It's disgusting that a Democrat would brag about his penis size in a nationally televised debate. Kids might see that stuff, and think that Democrats have large penises. This is something, like soliciting foreign election interference, committing crimes in office, and having the government pay millions to one's personal businesses, that only Republicans are allowed to do.&rdquo;
