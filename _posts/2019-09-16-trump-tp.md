## Screams Heard From The Bathroom

Screams were heard this morning from a toilet the President was using. After initial alarm, it was discovered that the President's usual supply of gold foil sheets had been forgotten, and the POTUS accidentally used regular toilet paper.

Normally, toilets in an area the President might be in are stocked with thin gold foil sheets, which the President uses as toilet tissue. Some staffer is likely in hot water, as this was unfortunately forgotten this morning, to dramatic result.
