## America Is A Rugged Individual, Just Like Republicans

Whiny, bitch-ass liberal pussies are complaining about our most high and tremendous lord and master, President Trump, abandoning our Kurdish allies and leaving them to be butchered, raped, and pillaged by the Turkish and Russian military. But Trump has captured ISIS. The Kurds didn't do shit. We never needed them to start, and we definitely don't need them now. Trump singlehandedly did what those Kurds couldn't do, even with his debilitating bone spurs.

America, as a country, is a rugged individual, like Republicans are. And Republicans don't need <b>anyone</b> else. The build their own roads, educate their own children, put out their own fires, and generate their own electricity. Republicans <b>never</b> need help from anyone else for anything, and neither does America. Did we have help in World War Two? No! We beat the Germans and the Japs all by ourselves, with no help from anyone. We're so tough, we can beat the whole world, so why do we need to be friendly to these weak, bitch ass nations and groups of people? Fuck 'em! What are they gonna do, all band against us? Refuse to help when we need it? We <b>never</b> need help, and we can beat them all put together. What, they won't buy our products? Pfft! We'll just make 'em buy them!

Look what happened with the mujahideen in Afghanistan, when we armed and trained them to fight the Russian army. We split and left them behind with our armaments and knowledge of our tactics, and nothing bad came from that, right? So what could possibly happen now? They'll hate us? So what? How could they possibly hurt us? Fly a plane into a building or some shit? Yeah right.
