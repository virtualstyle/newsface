excerpt: "Like the 3rd greatest US President (behind Trump and Reagan), Richard M. Nixon said, &rdquo;when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.&ldquo; There is no such thing as a corrupt US President. As the founders intended, the President is like a king, the embodiment of sovereignty, appointed by God. The President is never to be held accountable to the people, as he doesn not derive his power from the people, but from God."

## Great Minds Think Alike

Richard Nixon understood the design of our country&apos;s founders better than most. He **knew** that they intended the President to be separate from and above the law. This is utterly necessary to enable the President to do whatever it takes to ensure his own reelection. Because reelection is the highest purpose of any President, the most important thing in all the world. So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMt8qCl5fPk" target="_blank">&rdquo;when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.&ldquo;</a> President Trump is simply following in the footsteps of our 3rd greatest President ever in the history of our union.

Just like Nixon managed to stall peace talks during the Viet Nam war to help his election efforts, President Trump is just doing what he feels he needs to do to get reelected. If it was ok for Nixon to basically cause the deaths of hundreds or thousands of US service members when he artificially extended the war by scuttling peace talks, then **surely** a tiny little bit of corruptly inviting foreign meddling in a US election is ok, right?
