## House Democrats Violate The Constitution In Blatant Disregard Of Their Oath

Today is a dark day for America. House Democrats, in a Salem witch hunt to subvert the will of the people, used the power they have subverted via popular vote to ram through &ldquo;articles of impeachment&rdquo; against the second coming of Christ, President Donald J. Trump.

## WHERE In The Constitution Does It Mention Impeachment?

While <b>nowhere</b> in the Constitution does it say Presidents can be impeached, those damn dirty Democrats have gone ahead and done so. This reporter has <b>read</b> the Constitution, and <b>all</b> it says is, &ldquo;The right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&rdquo;

## Rich White Men Cannot Be Criminals

Nothing else. The fake news is swarming to make a big deal of this, as if the President is just a common criminal. But <b>we</b> know he&apos;s not. He&apos;s rich! Rich people are not criminals, it&apos;s axiomatic. Just by being rich, he is better than all the rest of us and deserves nothing but our undying respect and worship, and nothing he does can be wrong.

Like he said himself, he could shoot someone in broad daylight on 5th avenue, and it would be God&apos;s own will. He is our Orange Jesus and anything he does is sacred and blessed. Of course, <b>we</b> can&apos;t do the same things, or we&apos;d go to prison, but if <b>he</b> does it, it&apos;s perfect and right.

## Thank God For A Principled GOP Senate

Thank <b>God</b> the Senate is controlled by people of principle, who will adhere to the Constitution and not follow along with this heretical witch hunt of an investigation, people who <b>know</b> that holding a rich white man accountable for his actions is complete and total blasphemy, and tantamount to spitting in the face of our founding fathers.

The Senate GOP, as they have already said, will dispose of this nonsense about &ldquo;defending the Constitution,&rdquo; and &ldquo;upholding the law and proving that no one in America is above the law&rdquo; in a quick fashion, allowing the President to get back to making the rich richer and doing whatever he has to to get reelected.
