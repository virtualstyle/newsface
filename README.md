## Editor Instructions

1. Write your article

2. Find an image for your article on [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com).

3. Download the image and copy the download credit link. Paste it somewhere for later use.

4. Go to [Befunky](https://www.befunky.com/), click Open and then Computer and upload the file you downloaded from Unsplash.

5. Click Crop, select the Square aspect ratio, and position the cropping square as you desire, then click the blue checkmark.

6. Click Resize, and change width and height to 450px.

7. Click the blue checkmark, then click Save (by Open), Computer, and save. You should rename the file to reflect its content (don't forget the .jpg file extension).

8. Close the popups and click Resize again, and change width and height to 160px.

9. Click the blue checkmark, then click Save (by Open), Computer, and save. This file name needs to be the same as the first saved file, above, but add "-thumb" just before the file extension (.jpg).

10. Go to the [assets/img upload page](https://github.com/virtualstyle/newsface/upload/master/assets/img), drag or select the first image file you created, and click the green Commit Changes Button.

11. Go to the [assets/img/thumbs upload page](https://github.com/virtualstyle/newsface/upload/master/assets/img/thumbs), drag or select the second image file you created, and click the green Commit Changes Button.

12. Go to the [post template](https://github.com/virtualstyle/newsface/tree/master/posts/_template.md), click Raw, then select and copy the contents.

13. Go to the [posts directory](https://github.com/virtualstyle/newsface/tree/master/posts) and click Create New File. Name the new file in the format like 2019-09-16-file-name.md. Paste in the contents you copied from the template.

14. Enter your title, delete all the category names except the one your post fits, add your author name and title, a brief excerpt describing the article, the name of the first image file created and uploaded above, the unsplash credit saved from step 3, and a descriptive alt tag for your photo next to their labels.

15. Paste your article in, using the format of subheadings and paragraphs like the example. Any [Github Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) can be used in the article. When done, click the green Create New File button.
